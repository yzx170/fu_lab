# PASE model single cell RNA sequencing analysis

## Project Overview
We have developed a microfluid-based stem cell model that recapitulates the early symmetry breaking event in human embryonic development that gives rise to the amnionic ectoderm (featured in [Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1535-2)). This project aims at examining the single cell RNA sequencing data of those microfluidic amniotic sac embryoid (Î¼PASE) to uncover the mystery of early human embryonic development.

## Scripts

### Integration Analysis
In this script, we performed integration analysis among downsampled PASE, [CS7 human gastrula](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04158-y), human E9E11 gastruloid and pre-implantation data. 

### New Old Comparison
We compared the transcriptomic data of PASE between our latest sequencing results and our previous results to validate the consistency of our model. 

### Cell Chat
We used [CellChat](http://www.cellchat.org/) package to analyze the ligand-receptor interactions within our model. 

### SCENIC
We used [SCENIC](https://scenic.aertslab.org/) package to analyze the gene regulatory network within our model.
