# PASE model single cell RNA sequencing analysis

## Project Overview
We have developed a microfluid-based stem cell model that recapitulates the early symmetry breaking event in human embryonic development that gives rise to the amnionic ectoderm (featured in [Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1535-2)). This project aims at examining the single cell RNA sequencing data of those microfluidic amniotic sac embryoid (Î¼PASE) to uncover the mystery of early human embryonic development.
