# Neural Tube

## Project Overview
We have developed a microfluidic-based neural tube-like structure (NTLS) that recapitulates the rostrocaudal and dorsoventral patterning of human central nervous system from brain to spinal cord. This repository hosts the scripts used in the data analysis of the project. 

### Platform: 
Matlab
### Publication
Under Review

### Data Availability
All data used in this repository is available upon request. 


## Scripts

### Gradient Quantification
Because the patterning is achieved using microfluidic gradient. We used 60kDa Dextran beads to quantify the gradient formation within our microfluidic device. This script analyzes the spatial and temporal fluorescence change within the device channel. 

### Heatmap Generation
This script analyzes the expression of genetic markers that are specific to each region of the neural tube to highlight the patterning.
