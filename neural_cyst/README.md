# Rostrocaudal Patterning of Neural Cyst Array

## Project Overview
This work-in-progress project aims at performing rostrocaudal patterning on neural cyst-like tissue array. 

### Platform:
Python 




## Scripts

### Neural Cyst Formation

1. Phase cell counting: this script counts the number of cells within each cluster on a phase image. 
2. Phase Area Measurement: this script measures the area of each colony within a phase image.
