## PASE model single cell RNA sequencing analysis

#### Project Overview
We have developed a microfluid-based stem cell model that recapitulates the early symmetry breaking event in human embryonic development that gives rise to the amnionic ectoderm. This project aims at examining the single cell RNA sequencing data of those microfluidic amniotic sac embryoid (Î¼PASE) to uncover the mystery of early human embryonic development.
